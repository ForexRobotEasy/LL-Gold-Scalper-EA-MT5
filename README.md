## Overview

The LL Gold Scalper EA MT5 is a trading robot designed to automatically execute trades in the gold market. It uses market data analysis to identify trading opportunities and executes trades based on predefined parameters.

The following trading parameters can be configured:

- StopLoss: The stop loss level in pips.
- TakeProfit: The take profit level in pips.
- RiskPercentage: The risk percentage per trade.
- MaxPositions: The maximum number of open positions.

## Expert Initialization

The `OnInit` function is called during the expert initialization. In this function, the trading parameters are set using the Trade library. The Timeseries library is also initialized for market data analysis.

## Expert Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit` function is called during the expert deinitialization. In this function, the Timeseries library is deinitialized.

## Expert Tick

The `OnTick` function is called on every tick of the market. In this function, it checks for trading opportunities using the `FindTradingOpportunity` function. If a trading opportunity is found, it executes the trade using the `ExecuteTrade` function.

## Find Trading Opportunity

The `FindTradingOpportunity` function is responsible for analyzing market data and identifying trading opportunities. The code for analyzing market data should be added here. If a trading opportunity is found, the function should return `true`, otherwise `false`.

## Execute Trade

The `ExecuteTrade` function is responsible for executing trades on behalf of the trader. The code for executing trades should be added here.

## Expert Start

The `OnStart` function is the main entry point of the expert advisor. It runs the expert advisor 24/7 by continuously calling the `OnTick` function and sleeping for 1 second before checking for the next tick.

Please note that this is a sample code and the actual implementation may vary. For the official version of LL Gold Scalper EA MT5, please refer to the developer on the MQL5 platform.
